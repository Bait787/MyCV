            <p class="name">Harry Veale - 21.</p>
            <p>
                I am an energetic, always keen-to-learn person experienced with technology and a strong intrest in music (particularly rock / orchestral arrangements).
                I work well in a team, whether in person or via teams calls to keep projects rolling and every party involved informed and up-to-date.
                Learning more about the behind the scenes has always been an intrest of mine from the early days of school, from silly inspect element edits and messing around with apps like Scratch or Python to create simple apps/games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to Covid, it made it difficult to pursue this hobby in education further as moving around and travel was very difficult post-GCSE. Having had experience in an E-commerce environment,
                helping people behind the scenes to setup features, brainstorm ideas and assisting in feedback it has re-ignited the spark for web development myself and i can now finally pursue it properly.

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p>I worked for British Garden Centres between Nov 2022 - Oct 2025 as an e-commerce Web Assistant. This was primarily copywriting for products, blogs as well as some data analysis and photoshop editing.
                I liased with buyers/suppliers for product information and images to edit and fit them to web-spec using softwares like Fidelity, Corby & Fellas and Tableau for reports.</p>
            <p>
                I also had input with both the front-end developers for site changes, as well as back-end developers for application and process changing for a smoother operation.
                Blogs are another section i had, using Wordpress to edit a simple page and structure it to standard spec. Here is an example of one i created: 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britishgardencentres.com/how-to-create-a-terrarium-an-ecosystem-of-its-own/">How To Create a Terrarium</a>. It used to have a video at the bottem, but i believe it got removed.
